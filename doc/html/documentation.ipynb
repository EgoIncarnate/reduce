    "### The functional genome of reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of _reducing_ is central to the \"_programming experience_\" in functional languages. A formal definition would go like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In functional programming, **fold** – also known variously as **reduce, accumulate, aggregate, compress**, or **inject** – refers to a family of **higher-order functions** that analyze a recursive data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombine the results of recursively processing its constituent parts, building up a return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this definition, here's some info on the terminology: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **higher order function**: functions that can take functions as parameters and/or return functions as return values\n",
    "- **recursive data structure**: also known as recursively-defined, it's a data type for values that may contain other values of the same type. For an example a list in `Haskell` is (either an empty list or) a _head_ element of some type followed by a _tail_ element that's a list of the same type. \n",
    "- **combining operation**: we'll be calling it a **reducing function** or **reducers**; it's any function which takes a partial result and a new piece of information to produce a new result.\n",
    "- **accumulator**: this is included in the definition as _partial result_; essentially it \"contains\" the type of the value we reduce our recursive data structure to. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example if we were to `reduce` the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using the operator `(+)` we'd get the sum of the list i.e. `15`. Depending on where we \"_fold from_\" we get **left** or **right** folds. Let's look at some formal definitions for the types of these operations: \n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "-- type of the left fold operation\n",
    "foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above informs us that `foldl` is a (higher order) function that accepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a function `(b -> a -> b)` i.e. a function that takes an accumulator of type `b` and a value of type `a` and returns a partial result of type `b`\n",
    "2. an accumulator of type `b`\n",
    "3. a list of `a`s\n",
    "\n",
    "and returns a reduced value of type `b`"
